# Odin Project (Ruby): Ruby Building Blocks

The three methods found here are a part of The Odin Project. 
* The first method covers creating a Caesar Cipher. 
* The second covering making a stock picker. 
* The last creating a method that checks to see if a substring is found within a given string.
